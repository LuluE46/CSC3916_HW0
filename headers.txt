Definitions taken from mozilla.org

Content-Type: 
-used to indicate the media type of the resource 

Vary: 
-determines how to match future request headers to decide whether a cached response can be used rather than requesting a fresh one from the origin
 server. Used by server to indicate which headers it used to select a representation of a resource in a content negotiation algorithm.

Content-Encoding:
-entity header is used to compress the media-type. When present, its value indicates which encodings were applied to the entity-body. It lets the 
 client know how to decode in order to obtain the media-type referenced by the Content-Type header.

Date:
-general HTTP header contains the date and time at which the message was originated.

Server:
-header describes the software used by the origin server that handled the request â€” that is, the server that generated the response.

Cache-Control:
-HTTP header holds directives (instructions) for caching in both requests and responses. A given directive in a request does not mean the same 
 directive should be in the response.

X-XSS-Protection:
-response header is a feature of Internet Explorer, Chrome and Safari that stops pages from loading when they detect reflected cross-site scripting 
 (XSS) attacks. Although these protections are largely unnecessary in modern browsers when sites implement a strong Content-Security-Policy that 
 disables the use of inline JavaScript ('unsafe-inline'), they can still provide protections for users of older web browsers that don't yet support 
 CSP. X-Frame-Options

X-Content-Type-Option:
-response HTTP header is a marker used by the server to indicate that the MIME types advertised in the Content-Type headers should not be changed and 
 be followed. This is a way to opt out of MIME type sniffing, or, in other words, to say that the MIME types are deliberately configured.

Alt-Svc:
-HTTP response header is used to advertise alternative services through which the same resource can be reached. An alternative service is defined by a 
 protocol/host/port combination.

Transfer-Encoding:
-header specifies the form of encoding used to safely transfer the payload body to the user.
